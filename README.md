# Hardbound

Hardbound is a SolidJS framework built for Deno.

## Notes:
* Very unstable, lots of things might change, use at your risk!
* Hardbound is mostly a client-side framework. There is no server-side rendering (yet?)

## Features:
* No compilation needed
* Uses SolidJS for performance
* Hot Reloading for better DX

## How to

For the moment, Hardbound does not have a setup for new projects.

You can however, run the example and try it yourself.
