# Hardbound

Hardbound is a SolidJS framework built for Deno.

## Notes:
* Very unstable, lots of things might change, use at your risk!
* Hardbound is mostly a client-side framework. There is no server-side rendering (yet?)
* Hardbound doesn't have a development mode yet, so no hot reloading.

## Features:
* No compilation
* Uses SolidJS for performance
